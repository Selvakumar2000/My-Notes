SQL and STORE PROCEDURE:
------------------

1.SET NOCOUNT ON : 
-------------------
=>It is a set statement which prevents the message which shows the number of rows affected by T-SQL query statements. 
This is used within stored procedures and triggers to avoid showing the affected rows message.

2.WITH (NOLOCK) : 
------------------
=>Use nolock when you are okay with the "dirty" data. Which means nolock can also read data which is in the process of being 
modified and/or uncommitted data.The WITH (NOLOCK) table hint is used to override the default transaction isolation level of the table or the tables
within the view in a specific query, by allowing the user to retrieve the data without being affected by the locks, on the requested data, due to 
another process that is changing it.

3.VARCHAR vs NVARCHAR : 
------------------------
=>If you have requirements to store UNICODE or multilingual data, nvarchar is the choice. Varchar stores ASCII data and should be your data type of choice for normal 
use. Regarding memory usage, nvarchar uses 2 bytes per character, whereas varchar uses 1.varchar is stored as regular 8-bit data(1 byte per character) and nvarchar 
stores data at 2 bytes per character. Due to this reason, nvarchar can hold upto 4000 characters and it takes double the space as SQL varchar.

4.SQL Constraint:
------------------
=>NOT NULL Constraint − Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.
=>DEFAULT Constraint − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.
=>UNIQUE Constraint − Ensures that all values in a column are different.
=>PRIMARY Key − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.
=>FOREIGN Key − Uniquely identifies a row/record in any of the given database table.
=>CHECK Constraint − The CHECK constraint ensures that all the values in a column satisfies certain conditions.
=>INDEX − Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.

Note**  -->Constraints can be specified when a table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement or you can use the ALTER TABLE statement to create constraints
even after the table is created.
       -->Any constraint that you have defined can be dropped using the ALTER TABLE command with the DROP CONSTRAINT option.

5.Integrity Constraints :
---------------------------
=>It is used to ensure accuracy and consistency of the data in a relational database. Data integrity is handled in a relational database through the concept of
referential integrity.There are many types of integrity constraints that play a role in Referential Integrity (RI).
=>These constraints include Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique Constraints and other constraints which are mentioned above.

6.JOIN:
----------
=>INNER JOIN   − returns rows when there is a match in both tables.They are also referred to as an EQUIJOIN.
=>LEFT JOIN    − returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.
=>RIGHT JOIN   − returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.
=>FULL JOIN    − returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.FULL JOIN combines the results of both left and right outer joins.
	         The joined table will contain all records from both the tables and fill in NULLs for missing matches on either side.
**Note:  -->If your Database does not support FULL JOIN (MySQL does not support FULL JOIN), then you can use UNION ALL clause to combine these two JOINS as shown below.
SQL> SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   LEFT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID
UNION ALL
   SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   RIGHT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID

=>SELF JOIN    − is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

=>VARBINARY CONVERSION
    UPDATE RFQ.RFQAttachmentContent SET AttachmentContent =CONVERT(varbinary, 'content') WHERE AttachmentContentID=2;
