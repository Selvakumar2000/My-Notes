								Learn Angular:
							----------------------------
1.Framework to build client side application.
2.Great For  Single Page Application where parts of the view get refreshed asynchronously without having reload the entire page.
3.Any application that heavily relies on javascript, angular is a great choice.
4.Features --> #Modular Approach #Reusable Code #Development Quicker and Easier(Routing,Forms and so on)  #Unit Testable #Angular is a product from Google and MS

In any framwork there is always room for improvements and same in the case with angular.
Google team decided to  update the angular version twice a year and stick to semantic versioning.
Semantic Versioning:
--------------------
1.Version  for example 10.2.9 in angular
i.    10 is a major version number --> it changes when there is a break in any of the functionalities (in angular this version is changed twice a year by google team)
ii.  .2 is a minor version number -->it increases when there are features added however it doesnot  break any functionality
iii. .3 is a patch number  -->it increase anytime when there is a bug fix or some sort of patch

Nodejs LTS installed and npm(node package manager comes along with)
CLI -> command line interface.It allows to generate building blocks of angular application by typing a commands (i.e. ng commands)

Angular Architecture:
---------------------
1.Angular App  -> one or more modules
2.Module       -> One or more components and services
3.Component    -> Html+css+ts
4.Services     -> Business logic
5.Modules interact and ultimately render the view in the browser.

Commands:
---------
1.Install Nodejs from google -->to check version node -v and npm -v
2.Install Angular and CLI -->npm install -g @angular/cli & to check version -->ng version
3.Create Application -->ng new app_name
4.Move to the Application -->cd app_name
5.Run Server -->ng serve
6.Create Routing -->ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app
  Routing:
	i.add this line into head tag--> <base href="/">
	ii.add RoutingModule and forRoot() method into imports of app.module.ts file and create Routes array.
	iii.add router-outlet tag where you want to display your content
7.To open our project into vs code --> code .
8.ng g p mypipe --> To create a custom pipe

ngLifeCycle: (working example in angularmaterial project)
-------------
1.A component has a lifecycle mananged by angular.Angular
	-->Creates the component
	-->Renders the component
	-->Creates and renders the component childern
	-->Checks when the component data-bind properties change and
	-->Destroys the component before removing it from the DOM
2.To tap into and react when these lifecycle events occur, angular offers several lifecycle hooks, order in which these lifecycle hooks are specified is the order
in which they executed.They are,

  -->ngOnChanges*
#Executes, every time the value of an input property changes. The hook method receives a SimpleChanges object containing current and previous property values.
#This is called before ngOninit.This is the only method which receives input paramater of type simpleChanges. currentValue, firstChange and previousValue can be get
from simpleChanges property.

  -->ngOninit*
#Executes, after the constructor and after ngOnChange hook for the first time. It is most commonly used for component initialization and retrieving data from db.
#execute only during component initialization.
#It is called which indicates that the angular is done creating the component.
  
-->ngDoCheck*
#Executes, whenever the property or template anything changes in the component.
	i.   ngAfterContentInit
	ii.  ngAfterContentChecked
	iii. ngAfterViewInit
	iv.  ngAfterViewChecked

  -->ngOnDestroy*
#Executes, just before angular destroys the component and generally used for performing cleanup.

 -->ngAfterContentInit*
#Executes, only one time when the content is rendered on a page

 -->ngAfterContentChecked*
#Executes, whenever any changes in the component it executed and checked any changes occured?

 -->ngAfterViewInit*
#Executes, only one time after successful rendering of that component html it will execute

 -->ngAfterViewChecked*
#Executes, every rendering of that component html it will execute and checked any changes occur in the template
	

3.Steps to use the lifecycle hooks
Step:1 Import the lifecycle hook interface
Step:2 Make the component class implement the lifecycle hook interface
Step:3 Write the implementation code for the lifecycle interface method. 

bootstrap -->a technique of loading a program into a computer by means of a few initial instructions which enable the introduction of the rest of the program 
--------

Important Files:
-------------------
1.package.json -> contains the dependencies and dev dependencies which are the libraries/packages or modules that are required for our angular application.
packages are get installed when we run the ng new command and all the packages get installed inside the node_modules folder.

2.src folder -> contains app-root module and app-root component and main.ts and that main.ts file is a entry point to our application.It will bootstrap the
appmodule and appmodule bootstrap the appcomponent --> app component have appcomponent-template and appcomponent.ts(which control the view logic)

Component:
----------
have,
1.Template --> view Html
2.Class   --> properties and methods
3.MetaData -->this is the information that angular needs to decide if the paricular class is in fact an angular component or just a regular class.It is defined
using decorator which is a feature in typescript.Decorator is just a function that provides an information about the function about the class attached to it and
for the component we use the component decorator

3ways to use the selector to display the component view:
-------------------------------------------------------
1.
class file: selector: 'app-root',
html file : <app-root> </app-root>
2.
class file: selector: '.app-root',
html file : <div class="app-root">  </div>
3.
class file: selector: '[app-root]',
html file : <div app-root>  </div>

Attribute vs Property:
----------------------
1.Both are not same.
2.Attributes are defined by html and Properties are defined by DOM(Document Object Model).
3.Attributes initialise DOM properties and they are done. Attribute values cannot change once they are initialized.However property values can change.
4.So binding in angular , we are binding to the property of the DOM element 
$0.getAttribute('value');  --> not change
$0.value --> did change with respect to the field value

Directive:
---------
1.Directive is custom html attribute that angular provides.Structural Directive is used to add or remove Html elements (ngIf,ngFor,ngSwitch)
2.ngClass directive is used to apply multiple classes based on the condition we provide.
3.We need to import FormsModule from angular/forms
3.If tou want to know abut the event like click,submit pass the event inside the method wwe call (click) = "welcome($event)"
$event --> is a special variable in angular and it gives all the information about the DOM event that was raised.
4.ng-template tag is a container for other elements like the ngIf directive can use to properly add or remove locks of html from the DOM.

Custom Directive:
------------------
1.It is used for modify the DOM or modify the html element.(Ex. to show or hide conditionaly)
2.ng g directive myDirective
3.Custome Directive:[directive_name]
4.Custom Structural Directive : *directive_name

Two Way Binding:
-----------------
1.It allows us to update a property at the same time display the value of that property and to achieve this angular provide ngModel directive.
2.When we work with form inputs, it is essential that our model and the view are always in sync otherwise the data might not be consitent.
3.Ex: Consider a login form, this has a userName and password and the component class have the corresponding properties username and password whenever the
user updates these input controls our model or properties should automatically receive those values and when there is an update in the model or property value
the view should automatically reflect the updated values.

Component Interaction:
-----------------------
1.By default app-component is a parent component and all other components are child component.
2.In some cases parent component sends data to child component and vice versa.
3.Component interaction is achieved by @Input() and @Output() decorators.
4.@Input() decorator -> the child component can accept input from the parent component.
5.@Output() decorator -> the child component will send out events to the parent component and indicate something.
6.Task: Send name from the appcomponent to angular-features component and int the angular-features component we are going to display Hello and followed by the name
for example "Selva" and similarly we are going to send message Hey Software Engineer from the angular-features component to appcomponent and display that message
in that appcomponent. 
7.For sending parent to child component interaction we have child component selector tag inside the parent component.So we can easily sends the data.For sending data
from child to parent we don't have parent component selector inside the child component so we use events(EventEmitter) to sends data from child to parent.

Pipes:
------
1.Allows us to transform the data before displaying them in the view.
2.Aavailable pipe for String: lowercase, uppercase, titlecase, slice:index:limit (index denotes that where the string has to start.limit denotes where to stop)
 For ex: slice:3:6 start at index 3 and ends before 6th index (include the index:exclude the limit), json
3.Available pipe for Number: number, percent, currency
4.Available pipe for date: date,short,shortDate,shortTime,medium,mediumDate,mediumTime,long,longDate,longTime
5.Number pipe: The parameter has this syntax:

{minIntegerDigits}.{minFractionDigits}-{maxFractionDigits}
So example of '1.2-2' means:
A minimum of 1 digit will be shown before decimal point
It will show at least 2 digits after decimal point
But not more than 2 digits

Services:(Central Repository)
------------------------------
1.service is a class with specific purpose
2.DRY(Do not Repeat yourself) Principle
3.Single Responsibility Principle
4.Shared Data across multiple components
5.Implement Application logic
6.External Interactions

Dependency Injection:
----------------------
1.Injecting the Dependencies into the class is known as Dependency Injection.Instead of creating an instance using new keyword, we can inject the class
using dependency injection concept in angular(define a property of type in the constructor)
Define the EmplyeeService class --> Form the DataSource (like get all the employee details from DB)
2.Register with Injector --> inside providers array but in angular12,we have provideIn injectable so don't need to define it inside app module.
3.Declare as dependency in EmpList and EmpDetails --> specify it in the constructor of required class
4.@Injectable() decorator --> this tells angular that this service might itself have injected dependencies.
So if we want to inject a service into another service,
injectable decorator is must.mostly all services are independent only it depends with root.it is must for service not for component

HTTP Mechanism:
---------------
	EmpList(component)  

						                    Get			           Request                Server
			    	 	                        ------------->			------------->
			-------------->	    EmpService                              Http                                 (Server Layer)        DB
								<-------------	                <-------------	
							          Observable		           Response


	EmpDetail(component)

1.Components are make use the service class for the data.
2.Http request accesss the WebAPI or WebService to fetch the data from the DataBase and it send it send back as an HTTP response and the response we get back
from the http call is an observable.Now the service fill needs to cast this observable into an array of employees(in this case) and return to it components.

Observable:
------------
1.Observables is a sequence of items that arrive asynchronously over time and observale is a HTTP response arrives asynchronously from db to service.
2.Newspaper company rely on datasource and form a data in the newspaper such as headline,body,cricketnews and so on and then sends it to the house only
they are subscribe to this newspaper.subscriber some time read the newspaper or sometime they make use of this paper for other works.
(another example: only subscribed user will receive videos from the subscribed youtube channel.once the youtube channel
sends the video to the subscribers their work done,it is not neccessary does every subscriber needs to watch).
3.Similarly servicee receives an observable and process it.Only subscribed user can read the data.
4.RxJS(Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a librarry which enables us to work with observables.
5.Observable which sending the data and observer who receives and work with that data. It is imported from rxjs library.
 
Routing:
----------
1.<base href="/"> in index.html is required so that the application knows how to construct the URLs to navigating.
2.wildcard route(**) must be at last position.
3.Configure Routes Array with most specific at top and least specific at bottom.
4.path: '' , redirectTo: '/departments', pathMatch:'prefix' -> empty path is prefix to anypath pathMatch:'full' -> redirect only if full url is empty
5.Route Parameters Reference --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh5nHv-4aw0&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhBRAgFinJR8KHIrCdTkZcZ&index=25 

Template Driven Form: ngForm directive gives us all the information about the form.
---------------------
1.Template reference variable with ngForm
2.Two way binding
3.Validation:

		State 							Class if true 					Class if false
	The control has been visited 					ng-touched 					ng-untouched
	The control's value has changed  				ng-dirty 					ng-pristine
	The control's value is valid 					ng-valid 					ng-invalid

ngModel Properties:
------------------
		    Class  			 Property
		ng-untouched 			untouched
		ng-touched 			touched
		ng-pristine 			pristine
		ng-dirty 			dirty
		ng-valid			valid
		ng-invalid 			invalid

4.novalidate ->this will prevent browser validation from kicking in when the click on the submit button

Reactive Forms:
--------------
1.Code and Logic resides in the component class
2.No two way binding
3.Well suited for complex scenarios
4.Dynamic form fields
5.Custom validation
6.Dynamic validation
7.Unit Test
8.Entire form is represented as FormGroup and each form field is represented as FormControl class.
9.FormBuilder is a service by using this service we don't need to use FormGroup and FormControl classes.We can reduce the number of lines as well.
10.FormArray class makes it possible to maintain a dynamic list of controls.

Angular Material:
------------------
1.UI component library and provides us with components to build awesome user interfaces in quick time.
2.It is an implementation of Google's material design specification.
3.ng add @angular/material --> To add material into our project
4. dbdcdd
5.rgb(243, 242, 242)
6.2px solid rgb(190 190 191)
7.(opened)="openMep(true)" (closed)="closeMep(false)"

II.
1.Files and Folder in Angular
i.package.json
ii.node_modules
iii.src
	i.app
	ii.assets
	iii.environments
	iv.index.html
	v.main.js
	vi.style.css

III.
1.Create new Components -->ng generate component login (ng g c login)
	creating sub-component --> ng g c login/admin-login
2.Create module(all the components present inside the module)-->ng generate module userauth
3.Create component inside the modue -->ng g c userauth/gallery
4.Create Class file-->ng g class class-name (generate 2 files,main file and testing file)
5.Create service file-->ng g service api-service
6.Build project -->ng build

IV.Components
1.Adv.:Write header/footer file one time and use it in all the pages
2.Try to create many components like for header alone create header,search bar,menu components..we can easily 
manage them.
3.inline template,inline css,inline template inline css

V.
Flow of the Project
i.index.html-->main module which is app-->app's html-->calls each components html
2.if we made any change in json file,we must restart the server..strict ->flase(no need to mention datatype)

VI.Module
1.Contains components,services and pipes
i.Example User Authentication Module have signup,login and forgot password component and have api services and helpers pipes
ii.we have to register each module inside app.modules file

VII.
1.ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap -->Install boostrap
2.ng add @angular/material or ng add @angular/material@6.2.1 and npm ls @angular/material-->to know the version
