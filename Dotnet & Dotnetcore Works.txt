Dot Net -->provides FCL and CLR=>Application Portability and Automtic Garbage Collector(automaticmemory management)
----------------------------------
1.Frame Work Class(FCL) library provides UI,Database Connectivity,Cryptography,Web Development etc..
2.Provides Library and Run time environment
3..Net programs are runs in Common Language Runtime(CLR) 
4.Compilation in two phase ->
 i)Language Compiler
Respective Compiler compiles source code(cs,vb,other) and convert it into Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL)(common to all)
 ii)Just In Time(JIT)
JIT compiler converts MSIL into machine code
5.Common Language Specification(CSL) and Common Type System(CTS)
6.For example we are going to print the message in C# using writeline() methodd of Console class.This class resides in System namespace assembly which is provided by
FCL of .net framework.FCL provides so many assemblies which are resides in GAC(Global Assembly Cache).GAC contains strong named assembly

Non .NET Application
--------------------
=>High level programming language(C++,C#,F# etc..)-->Respective Compiler converts it into Native Code/Machine Code-->OS
=>This native code can not abe to run in different Operating System.

.NET Application
-------------------
=>High level programming language(C++,C#,F# etc..)-->Respective Compiler converts it into Intermediate Language(IL) .dll or .exe file-->CLR have JIT which is a 
Just In Time Compiler which converts IL to Native Code/Machine Code-->OS
=>CLR checks manifest(information about assembly dependencies) and assembly code(.dll or .exe)
=>IL(also called as CIL,MSIL,Managed Code) can run on any operation system which have .net framework(CLR)
"the same will happened in java"  compiler converts .java file which is our source code into .class file which is a byte code.Byte code will be converted into
native code/machine code using JVM .........

6.dotnet new console -->to create console application
7.dotnet run name_of_cs_file-->to run console application

8.dotnet new webapp -o Testwebapp-->to create web application
9.dotnet run -->to run dotnet web application
10.Entry point of ASP .Net core webapplication is program.cs-->calls configure and configureServices method of 
startup.cs during run time



ASP.NET
--------------------------
1.Web application framework developed by microsoft to build dynamic data driven web application and web services.
2.It is a subset of .NET framework and it is the successor to classic ASP(Active Server Page)
3.ASP.NET application runs unders microsoft IIS(Internet Information Service)
4.Calling business logics from controller --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWJayOop4k8

Blazzor
----------------------------
1.USE C# code for both front end and backend
2.browser only support html and js...here Web Assembly(WSAM) is used..Blazor can run the C# code directly in webbrowser using WSAM.
3.Single Page Application framework
4.Build client  side web apps. using C# and .NET instead of JS.

Progressive Web Apps
------------------------
1.Load instantly
2.Capable of working offline
3.App launch options
4.Automatic self-updates
5.Support for push notifications
6.Own app window
