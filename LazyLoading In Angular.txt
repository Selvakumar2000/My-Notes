Lazy Loading:
----------------
1.Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated.
2.It improves the speed of the application load time by splitting the application into several bundles. When the user navigates through the app,
the bundles are loaded as required.
3.Usually, Angular will load all components while starting the application (page). As you can see, all the declarations and imports are in app.module.ts file.
This file will load all imported components and injected providers during the first page load.
4.With Lazy Loading, the initially loaded application will look small.
5.Most of the time, users can see only the home page (home page component), but we need to download all the components at the first time.
This will make our application slow. That is why we need Lazy Loading to improve the performance of loading time of the application.

How Lazy Loading works:
------------------------
1.Lazy Loading is loaded only when we need to start the application for the first time. If the user navigates to a new page, then the component for that page will 
load immediately. Lazy loading avoids the need for downloading the component each time when you visit the page.

Commands Used:
---------------
1.ng new lazyDemo    --> create new project
2.ng generate module lazy --routing   --> create a new module and routing file also created
3.cd lazy  --> move into the module
3.ng generate component componentName --> create the component inside the module
*loadChildren property, you can lazy load modules
