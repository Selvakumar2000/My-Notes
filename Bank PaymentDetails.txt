Scaffolding
------------
Scaffolding is a technique used by many MVC frameworks like ASP.NET MVC, Ruby on Rails, Cake PHP and Node. JS etc., to generate code for 
basic CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations against your database effectively. Further you can edit or customize this auto generated code according to 
your need.

Enable OpenAPI support to avoid the use of Postman

C# language         ==> PascalCasing (most of the backend languages)
Angular,JavaScript  ==> camelCasing(Client Side Programming languages)
-----------------------------------this converion is taken by asp.net core---------------------------------------------------------



Paymeny API Creation:
-----------------------------
1.Enable CORS
  All web api  projects come with the security which blocks request coming from different domains.
  We write some code(instructions) to disable that security and allow the request to be served.

  class file -->Represents tables in the sql server database
  provide database connection credentials in appsetting.json file

Add Migration:
----------------
=>Add-Migration "InitialCreate"  - to create migration file
