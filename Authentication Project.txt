  class file         -->Represents tables in the sql server database
  class context file --> for creating table in database (Identity core db context)
  provide database connection credentials in appsetting.json file

	  entityframework core(version is what the version of ASP.net), entityframework sqlserver and entityframework core tools from nuget package manager
