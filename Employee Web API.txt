Employee Web API Creation:
-----------------------------
1.Enable CORS
  All web api  projects come with the security which blocks request coming from different domains.
  We write some code(instructions) to disable that security and allow the request to be served.

2.Make Json Serializer as default
  Add mvc.newtonsoft json from NuGet package manager -> version 3.1.16
=============>run the project and see the output in the default browser<=================

3.Create Models folder in the project and add class file in it.
  class file -->Represents tables in the sql server database
  provide database connection credentials in appsetting.json file


4.Add Controller to add API methods for department table and employee table
  Controllers --> add --> controller --> API Controller(empty) --> Give name
  use raw query / stored procedure  / entity framework for database commands
  define different API (get,post,put,delete) in the controller
  To work with database inside each API we need SQL Client package
  Test the API with Postman by using URLs. --> "url_from_browser"/api/controller_name  for post method=> body ->raw text ->JSON
  Create an API for upload the images into the folder and mention it in Starup.cs file
                        

Project Structure
-------------------------

	     i.Employee Component(add-edit-emp,show-emp)	                             (send/receive data)
5.Angular -----------------------------------------------> Shared Service <--------------------------------------------> Employee Web API
             ii.Dept. Component(add-edit-dep,show-dep)

	i.create new project  -->companyApp
	ii.add component      -->employee ,department
	iii.add subcomponent  -->add-edit-emp, show-emp, add-edit-dep, show-dep
	iv.add service        -->shared 
=>import service-module, http client module,form module in app.module.ts and add service module into providers
=>Observeable used to handle asynchronous requests and responses
=>add logic in service file for consumes all the API methods
  
=>Add Routing in the application
