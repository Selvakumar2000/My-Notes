Udemy Course - Asp.net core with Angular (Github Link --> https://github.com/TryCatchLearn/DatingApp)
------------------------------------------
1.Structural Directives --> modifies the domain object model in our html in someway (*ngFor,*ngIf,*dropdown-menu)
2.Angular is a casesensitive
3.Angular vs JQuery (DOM Manupulation issue)
4.add ngbootstrap --> ng add ngx-bootstrap  (adds both bootstrap and ngx-bootstrap)
5.npm install font-awesome --> to add stylish icons into our applications
6.Learn about ssl certificate and git 

For Any Application:
Requirements:
--------------
1.Users should be able to register
2.Users should be able to login
3.Users should be able to view other users
4.Users should be able privately message others

Important commands for skip html/css/test file creation:
---------------------------------------------------------
1.ng g c componentName -is -it --skip-tests
      -is for inline css, preventing style file creation
      -it for inline template, preventing html file creation
      --skip-tests to prevent .spec file(test file) creation

TemplateForms:
---------------
1.Two-Way Binding: We can bind data or properties in our component and display them in our templates and we can take data from something enters in the form and
update something inside our component. (ts file(.ts) --> template file(.html) & template file(.html)-->ts file(.ts))
2.One of the example is declare a variable users:any in ts file and user provided data in input field is taken and updated the users variable with the value
which was entered in the form field by the user.
3.Import FormsModule
4.Create a variable inside the .ts file
5.define #loginForm="ngForm" inside form tag which tells that we use angular form so that we can two way binding and also calls the method with appropriate event
like click,submit,ngSubmit(which works on both hit the submit button and hit enter) .(ngSubmit)="login()"
5.define name property inside input tag
6.Update the name property within the variable using two way binding syntax
7.Square Brackets --> for receiving from our components
  Parantheses --> data goes away (we are going from our template to our components).

Feature of using Service file in our Angular Application:
---------------------------------------------------------
1.Organized 
2.Use of Injectable Decorator --> that the created service can be injected into any other components or services in our application (@Injectable)
3.Provided In Roots (providedIn: 'root')--> in appmodule we have a providers array and it is empty.no need to mention our service inside that provided array
(older version of angular follow this but not now..its updated)
4.service is a singleton --> once we inject our service into a component,it gets initialized and it will stay initialized untill the application is closed 
/disposed/user close the browser/user move away from our application
5.mostly used for handling http requests

Observables:
-------------
1.New standard for managing async data included in ES7(EcmaScript2017 which compatable with modern browsers)
2.Introduce in Angular2
3.Observables are lazy collections of multiple values
4.Used in HTTP requests and we also using them when we want our component to observe values.It notify the changes(HTTP requests and Responses) and works accordingly.
5.Need to subscribe the observable for working with the data which the observable holds.(similar to youtube)
			Promise   						Observable
           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Providing a single future value 			  Emits multiple value
			Not lazy 						  lazy
		      cannot cancel  					able to cancel and can use with filter,map,reduce and other operators
	              synchronous 					       asynchronus

6.Pipe -> If you want to transform the stream of data of observable before we subscribe this we can use pipe(rxjs for angular)
7.On subscribing the observable,  we have 3 parts: response(data in the observable)res=>{},error(anything other than 200OK response)error=>{},additional()=>{}
8.Other than subscribe we have toPromise() method.It comes from JavaScript -->another way to get data from observable
9.async pipe subscribe and unsubscribe automatically from the observables.

1.ng g class _model/user --type=model --> create a class file which implies the LoginDto property
2.!! turns the object into boolean

Observables and Subscribe.....
-------------------------------------
		Subject Type 				     Each next Subscribe Receives
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	          Subject 					Only upcoming values
		Behaviour Subject 			One previous value and upcoming values
		Replay Subject  			All previous values and upcoming values
		Async Subject 				The latest value when the stream will close

Async Pipe:
----------------
1.prevent memory leaks,automatically unsubscribe the data once it is completed..if we subscribed other than http requests, we will use aync pipe.
2. === operator:
The triple equals operator ( === ) returns true if both operands are of the same type and contain the same value. If comparing different types for equality,
the result is false.

Angular Routing:
-------------------
1.PathMatch ->

Angular Toastr Service:
-----------------------
1.Install npm-toastr and browser-animations ->  npm install ngx-toastr for popup notifications.refer this site => https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-toastr
					        npm install @angular/animations --save 

Route Guard:
--------------
1.ng g guard auth 
Guard Provides 4 interface --> canActivate, canDeactivate, CanActivateChild, canLoad 
select canActivate interface --> activate the route or not. If all guards return true, navigation continues.If any guard return false,then the navigation is cancelled.

ng-container --> does not generate any html..not interfere with any html elements..best when you use conditional statements
npm install bootswatch --> for free bootstrap theme   reference --> https://bootswatch.com/

2.create a seperate file for storing third-party modules(other than angular specific modules) to make app module to simple and tidy.

Error Handling(using interceptors):
---------------
1.When we encountered any error(400,401,404,500...) in our angular application,we handle them at a global level inside our application.To achieve this using
Http Interceptors.
2.ng g interceptor then give a name.
intercept(intercept the request that goes out, the response that comes back in the next where we handle the response) method --> it returns an observable
so we can perform operations using pipe().
catchError(rxjs operator) -->catch the error response(HttpErrorResponse)
modalStateErrors????

3.provide interceptor in app module -->
providers: [
    {provide:HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,useClass:ErrorInterceptor,multi:true}
  ],
multi -> we don't want to replace the interceptor comes with angular..we want to add this to the interceptors.
we can have multiple interceptors 
es2018 and es2019..????
? -> optional chaining parameter
